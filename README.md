# Association Rule Mining â€“ Mini Assignment

**Objective:** Simulate transactional data and use association rule mining to discover shopping patterns.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- **Python** â€“ for scripting and data simulation
- **pandas** â€“ to structure and manipulate the dataset
- **mlxtend** â€“ to run the Apriori algorithm and generate association rules

You can install required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas mlxtend


ðŸ“œ What Each Code Cell Does
ðŸ“Œ Cell 1 â€“ Simulate Transaction Data
Defines a list of 8 unique items (e.g., Bread, Milk, Eggs, Butter, etc.).

Simulates 10 random transactions.

Each transaction contains between 2 to 5 randomly selected items.

This models real-world shopping behavior for market basket analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Cell 2 â€“ One-Hot Encode Transactions
Uses TransactionEncoder from the mlxtend.preprocessing module.

Transforms the list of transactions into a one-hot encoded format (True/False for each item per transaction).

Required preprocessing step for using the Apriori algorithm.

ðŸ“Œ Cell 3 â€“ Find Frequent Itemsets
Applies the Apriori algorithm from mlxtend.frequent_patterns.

Sets the minimum support threshold to 0.3 (30%).

Finds all itemsets (combinations of items) that appear in at least 30% of the transactions.

Outputs the list of frequent itemsets.

ðŸ“Œ Cell 4 â€“ Generate Association Rules
Uses association_rules() function from mlxtend.frequent_patterns.

Filters the rules by setting:

Metric: Confidence

Minimum threshold: 0.7 (70%)

Generates high-confidence rules based on the frequent itemsets.

Outputs key metrics for each rule, including:

Support â€“ How often the itemset appears in the dataset

Confidence â€“ How often the rule has been found to be true

Lift â€“ How much more likely the consequent is, given the antecedent

## ðŸ“Š Rule Explanations

### âœ… Rule 1: {Butter} â†’ {Cheese}
- **Confidence:** 1.00
- **Lift:** 1.67
- **Interpretation:** Every customer who bought Butter also bought Cheese. This strong rule suggests a reliable pattern â€” likely related to meal prep. A store could promote them together or use this pattern in product placement.

### âœ… Rule 2: {Bananas} â†’ {Eggs}
- **Confidence:** 0.75
- **Lift:** 1.50
- **Interpretation:** Customers who buy Bananas often also buy Eggs â€” possibly for breakfast. This can help stores create promotions or design better shelf layouts.
